TODO

- Be stricter with integer, etc limits, use limits.h, although this could break
  Windows compatability.
- BAM and SAM support (again, in C). With this branch, much of the number 
  gathering should be outside summarize_fastq_file C function.
- Right now, summarize_file takes an integer max_length that allocates the
  quality and base distribution matrices, and sequences that are longer than
  this cause an error. This variable must be less than the macro INIT_MAX_SEQ in 
  io.c. This is a bit messy, and should ultimately be replaced with a matrix that 
  transformed (and expanded) if a sequence longer than the allocated space is 
  encountered.
- The only acceptable nucleotides now are A, T, C, G, and N. We could allow 
  lowercase nucleotides too.
